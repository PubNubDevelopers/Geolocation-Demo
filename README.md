This geolocation tracking demo allows users to share locations and engage with each other in real-time from any device. 

Managing the locations of dozens or even hundreds of users, devices, vehicles presents a significant amount of challenges around collecting and presenting location information. This demo shows how PubNub can be used to do all of the heavy lifting for a geolocation app.

This demo is completely powered by PubNub and has no user limits. For more geolocation use cases and strategies, such as geofencing, our solution architect and support teams can help. Contact sales@pubnub.com
