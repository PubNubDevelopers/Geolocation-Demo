# Geolocation Tracking Demo

This geolocation tracking demo allows users to share locations and engage with each other in real time from any device. Interact with the demo in real time on [PubNub's website](https://www.pubnub.com/demos/geolocation-demo/). 

Managing the locations of dozens or even hundreds of users, devices, and vehicles presents a significant amount of challenges around collecting and presenting location information. This demo shows how PubNub can be used to do all of the heavy lifting for a geolocation app.

* [Messages](https://www.pubnub.com/docs/general/messages/publish): Send messages that contain application information in real time.
* [Message Persistence](https://www.pubnub.com/docs/general/storage): You will be able to see the user’s message history and metadata.
* [App Context](https://www.pubnub.com/docs/general/metadata/channel-metadata): This allows you to manage the metadata of your users and channels.
* ChatGPT Integration: Interact with ChatGPT via our [OpenAI GPT integration](https://www.pubnub.com/integrations/openai/) to receive historical features/facts about your location.
